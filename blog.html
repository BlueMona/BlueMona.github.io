I'd like to improve this. Here are some things I might look at in the future:

        <p>  
            Today I learned some more CSS. In particular, I learned about layout: how to move things around on a page and position elements in front of others. Fun stuff. If I delve into the documentation, I imagine I could start making much prettier web pages than the basic ones I have made so far. Right now, though, I think I'd like to add this blog to my github website project. It will have to get prettier, sure, but it will be a start.

        <p> I wouldn't normally write two posts in a day but the goal is to finish this project. I wonder if there is a way that I can use the system date function to date my posts. I'll have to figure that out. In the meantime I am considering hosting this on my old C.S. page. Of course I may eventually need to host it myself. I have been considering re-activating my dreamhost account. </p>

        <p>Yesterday I made a plan for the rest of the Khan Academy Computer Programming and Computer Science material. It looks like I'll be done by the end of August, and will then have to move on elsewhere on the site if I want to keep up the routine I've started of doing a topic a day, and elsewhere on the web if I want to continue working on these skills (there's Coursera, which I've used before, as well as Codecademy, w3schools, and perhaps others), but mostly I think I'll be wanting to create stuff to showcase the skills I've been building. </p> 
        <p>I've been religiously using Khan Academy since I first started using it to study for the LSAT on June 2nd. As soon as I had written the exam on June 11th, I started the Computer Programming material. I'd been meaning to go back to dusting off my coding skills, and the gamified platform made it easy and fun to do so. It's a strategic decision at this point: after completing my M.A. in Anthropology, I have found that CEGEP teaching jobs are hard to get. Most subjects require a Master's degree, but I've seen postings for computer science that only require a B.Sc. plus industry experience. Well, the industry experience is what I'm missing, and in order to get that, I'll have to prepare. </p>
        <p> I suppose anyone reading this may be surprised at the route I've taken. I first decided to study Computer Science in part because it was an excellent choice in terms of the job opportunities it opened up. It still is. I've recently subscribed to Indeed and, in comparison to the one or two daily notifications I get for "teacher" postings in Montreal, I'll get about 30 postings for "programmer" or "junior developer". </p>
        
        <p>Why didn't I seek such jobs before? Well, it was in part due to confidence issues (aggravated by certain people in my immediate environment who weren't particularly supportive), in part because I didn't really know how to go aboout finding jobs (I honestly feel my experience at McGill would have been better had there been some sort of mentorship program as part of the package... my faculty advisor was absolutely useless and treated me like I was in kindergarten), but largely because I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in a desk job staring at a screen for hours on end for some company. In retrospect I think I had no idea what kind of opportunities were available in tech. Most significantly, I didn't imagine I could be a programmer and an activist at the same time. The two worlds seemed completely antithetical.</p>
        
        <p>
        Well here I am now. A master's degree, a child, and a pending divorce later. Struggling to find a job relevant to the field into which I put so much passion for two years of my life ending in August 2017. In the past year I've taken many workshops (a year-long training in active listening, advocacy and harm reduction, a number of teaching, leadership, and French workshops, First-Aid certification and additional emergency response training) and significantly expanded my resume, and yet, no job aside from low-paying casual employment. </p>
        
        <p>
        Well, one reason I didn't mention above that motivated my choice of Computer Science for my undergraduate major was this: I don't particularly like staying in the same place for too long. I especially don't like stagnating. I felt like with Computer Science, I'd be able to work on a project, and when I was done, I could move on to something completely different. Well, it's time for a change. That's why I've now taken the plunge back into programming. And I feel like this time I'm ready. I'm no longer undervaluing my worth. I know I can make beautiful things. I can learn anything. I just need to put in the work.
