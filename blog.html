               Today Khan Academy gave me a chance to review Big-Theta, Big-O, and Big-Omega. And this was a good thing too, because I feel that, aside from Big-O, I didn't quite remember what they were and probably would have mixed them up. No programming today; just a few practice problems. I feel like this blog is getting long enough that by now I should be implementing more sophisticated post navigation.

               Today's Khan Academy lesson was on binary search. There was a project that involved implementing an iterative version in Javascript. I felt like it took me a bit longer to weed out the bugs than it should have, but I really do feel like I'm going to enjoy this section. I have been so busy these days though, so I haven't had much of a chance to really build anything beyond Khan Academy's lesson.

               Today I moved on to Khan Academy's algorithms section. The first lesson was a straightforward introduction to what algorithms are, nothing particularly exciting. But I'm looking forward to doing the rest of the section, as I think algorithms are exciting. I definitely feel by now, though, that I should really be working on a more significant project of my own.

               Today I finished the Khan Academy series on SQL. Unfortunately I got myself stuck in a loop by trying to do something that technically can be done, but shouldn't be. I was trying to parse out some data values to input into my table out of some other values already in the table. Due to a certain stubbornness and working into the wee hours of the morning due to the unfortunate choice of drinking an evening coffee, I spent more hours on this than I should have. Finally I gave up on these (unnecessary) efforts and completed the project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created a Stack Overflow account today, and realized they have a jobs section. To be honest, I am overwhelmed with the current number of job posting notifications that I am getting, so I may want to cut down on those so I can actually spend time preparing applications. There was an interesting feature, though: a link to a separate site that had quizzes in different skills. I tried the html5 and python quizzes, and while I only ranked in thee 32nd percentile or so in both, I was glad to at least be told I was "proficient" rather than a "novice". These quiz results can be featured on my StackOverflow and LinkedIn accounts, so now that I've got a sense of what they test, I'll try to use the remaining ones carefully (once I feel more confident in my skills, rather than as an initial diagnostic). I have access to a total of two free quizzes per topic. The site also offers courses, but there is a monthly fee. It's not too expensive, so I suppose it may be an option once I've exhausted free tutorials, since they include intermediate and advanced videos. On the other hand, free content isn't hard to come by, and my best bet may be to begin bigger projects once I'm at that level.

               Today's SQL lesson, about relational queries, was a bit more exciting than yesterday's. Funny, I remembered JOINs being tricky, but they were actually pretty alright. There were also some notes on query optimization, which I'll have to delve into when I get more involved in databases. I also ended up fixing up a third resume today and adding it to my webpage. This one is for writing/editing. What prompted this was the fact that yesterday, I applied to a "technical writing" job, and, not having an appropriate resume at the ready, simply uploaded my academic CV. Since that one is far too long to interest the average recruiter, I updated an old writing resume with my new colorful format and polished off the content. I'll have to become more active in actually sending applications from here on out though, as I won't be getting any offers if I don't send anyone my resume.

               Today I went further along in Khan Academy's SQL series (I'm now halfway through), and like I predicted, it's not particularly challenging or exciting. I also finally got around to completing an application for a Google Software Developer position I had been keeping hanging around my web browser. I had filled out the form but wanted to do the ("optional") cover letter copy/paste box properly. So today I spent some time on that cover letter. To make sure I properly addressed my relevant knowledge, I pulled out my McGill transcript. I plugged in a few courses and skills, and by the time I was done the cover letter, I had become aware that I have underestimated the degree to which I underestimate myself. I had done better in several relevant courses than I remembered, and I also came to recall that I in fact covered quite a lot of ground during my undergrad. It's true, a lot of those skills are "rusty", but the basis is there and is deeper and wider than I generally make it seem, even to myself.

                Well, I'm at a point where adding posts to this blog has become routine and lackluster. I've done what I can with the html/CSS in terms of improving the formatting, and in order to implement anything further, I'll have to go deeper into the topic, which means looking at resources beyond Khan Academy. In the meantime I have started getting back into SQL. I feel like this will be one of the easier topics I'll be reviewing. A bit of a break, I guess. I guess I worry a bit that as I delve into new topics I'll forget some of the other things I've been learning, but this anxiety may be related to my belief that I have to know and remember everything, which was probably what was behind my telling that Google recruiter years ago that I "wasn't ready" to work at the company. I'll just keep learning new things and building things and it will all mesh together as well as it can. If at any given time I don't remember a particular detail, the answer is always at my fingertips. And that's how it will be in any tech role I take on.

                I didn't get a chance to do a blog post yesterday and now I'm actually making up for that. I don't feel like I have much to say though. I finished the Khan Academy chapter on HTML and CSS today. The last couple of sections were pretty short; they were basically a few more tricks and where to learn more. I also learned about html validation <a href="https://validator.w3.org"> here</a>  today. That's pretty handy. I already used it to check my index.html and found a couple of errors and warnings. I also improved the spacing here and think I'm at a point where I will indeed have to explore content outside Khan Academy if I want to make any further improvements to my webpage. But soon I'll be moving on to a review of SQL. In the meantime, I'll have to figure out how to make this blog interesting to an audience besides myself.

                I learned a few more CSS identifiers today, but mainly spent the day sprucing up both my academic CV and my programming resume. I had heard it was a good idea to add some color, so I had to figure out how to do so in LaTeX. Since modifying the formatting for every single heading seemed tedious, it occurred to me that perhaps, as with CSS, there could be a way to do so in one shot for the whole document. As I discovered, there was. So not only did I improve the look of my CV and resume, I learned how to define my own LaTeX commands and greatly improve my efficiency in styling LaTeX documents from here on. Interesting how learning how to work with one language or tool can lead to transferred insights into the use of something else.

                Today I learned some more CSS. In particular, I learned about layout: how to move things around on a page and position elements in front of others. Fun stuff. If I delve into the documentation, I imagine I could start making much prettier web pages than the basic ones I have made so far. Right now, though, I think I'd like to add this blog to my github website project. It will have to get prettier, sure, but it will be a start.

            <p> I wouldn't normally write two posts in a day but the goal is to finish this project. I wonder if there is a way that I can use the system date function to date my posts. I'll have to figure that out. In the meantime I am considering hosting this on my old C.S. page. Of course I may eventually need to host it myself. I have been considering re-activating my dreamhost account. </p>

            <p>Yesterday I made a plan for the rest of the Khan Academy Computer Programming and Computer Science material. It looks like I'll be done by the end of August, and will then have to move on elsewhere on the site if I want to keep up the routine I've started of doing a topic a day, and elsewhere on the web if I want to continue working on these skills (there's Coursera, which I've used before, as well as Codecademy, w3schools, and perhaps others), but mostly I think I'll be wanting to create stuff to showcase the skills I've been building. </p> 
            <p>I've been religiously using Khan Academy since I first started using it to study for the LSAT on June 2nd. As soon as I had written the exam on June 11th, I started the Computer Programming material. I'd been meaning to go back to dusting off my coding skills, and the gamified platform made it easy and fun to do so. It's a strategic decision at this point: after completing my M.A. in Anthropology, I have found that CEGEP teaching jobs are hard to get. Most subjects require a Master's degree, but I've seen postings for computer science that only require a B.Sc. plus industry experience. Well, the industry experience is what I'm missing, and in order to get that, I'll have to prepare. </p>
            <p> I suppose anyone reading this may be surprised at the route I've taken. I first decided to study Computer Science in part because it was an excellent choice in terms of the job opportunities it opened up. It still is. I've recently subscribed to Indeed and, in comparison to the one or two daily notifications I get for "teacher" postings in Montreal, I'll get about 30 postings for "programmer" or "junior developer". </p>

            <p>Why didn't I seek such jobs before? Well, it was in part due to confidence issues (aggravated by certain people in my immediate environment who weren't particularly supportive), in part because I didn't really know how to go aboout finding jobs (I honestly feel my experience at McGill would have been better had there been some sort of mentorship program as part of the package... my faculty advisor was absolutely useless and treated me like I was in kindergarten), but largely because I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in a desk job staring at a screen for hours on end for some company. In retrospect I think I had no idea what kind of opportunities were available in tech. Most significantly, I didn't imagine I could be a programmer and an activist at the same time. The two worlds seemed completely antithetical.</p>

            <p>
            Well here I am now. A master's degree, a child, and a pending divorce later. Struggling to find a job relevant to the field into which I put so much passion for two years of my life ending in August 2017. In the past year I've taken many workshops (a year-long training in active listening, advocacy and harm reduction, a number of teaching, leadership, and French workshops, First-Aid certification and additional emergency response training) and significantly expanded my resume, and yet, no job aside from low-paying casual employment. </p>

            <p>
            Well, one reason I didn't mention above that motivated my choice of Computer Science for my undergraduate major was this: I don't particularly like staying in the same place for too long. I especially don't like stagnating. I felt like with Computer Science, I'd be able to work on a project, and when I was done, I could move on to something completely different. Well, it's time for a change. That's why I've now taken the plunge back into programming. And I feel like this time I'm ready. I'm no longer undervaluing my worth. I know I can make beautiful things. I can learn anything. I just need to put in the work.
