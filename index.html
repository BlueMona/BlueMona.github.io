                I am an educator, artist, community organizer, and coder. 
		<br />
		<br />
          
                I have been working in the technology field for 3+ years, primarily employed as a Quality Assurance Engineer, working with tools such as cucumber (BDD), WebdriverIO (Appium and Selenium) and Postman. While I code primarily in JavaScript, I've also worked on projects in Python as well as Java. I particularly enjoy playing with .yml CI pipelines and Bash scripting. 

		In addition, I've contributed to both frontend (React) and backend (REST/GraphQL) production code, and have recently also begun managing releases on my team at Rally.
		

		<br />
		<br />

		I'm always looking for new things to learn, whether tools to improve my productivity at work, or side projects to expand in other areas. 

		I enjoy playing with the linux terminal and learning about application security and penetration testing. In the past two years I've participated in <a href="https://montrehack.ca/">MontreHack</a> and <a href="https://nsec.io/">NorthSec</a> both as a learner and as a volunteer. 

		I appreciate open source, backward-compatibility and sustainable design in hardware and software, as well as privacy-preserving technologies,
		and make contributions to such projects when I can.

		I take pleasure in combining multiple generations of technology (I aspire towards having a setup like that of Adam in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714915/">Only Lovers Left Alive</a>).
		
		<br />
		<br />
		I'm currently working on my first video game through the <a href="https://pixelles.ca/pixelles-game-incubator/">Pixelles Game Incubator</a>. I am aiming to use the eight weeks of the Incubator to complete a teaser for a larger project,  in which I hope to incorporate elements of hardware and software hacking.  

		<br />
		<br />		
		In the past, I have worked as a teaching assistant for both Introductory Computer Science and Anthropology courses. 
		I have taught a course on basic computer skills to hard-of-hearing individuals. I have also taught English as a Second Language, and have significant experience as a tutor.
		Courses I have tutored for have included high school math and science, test prep (SAT), and university-level courses on introductory programming, qualitative research methods, and statistics.             
		<br />
		<br />

		I have 
		an M.A. in Social and Cultural Anthropology from Concordia University in Montreal, and
		a B.Sc. from McGill University (joint major in Computer Science and Biology).
