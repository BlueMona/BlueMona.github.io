                I am an educator, artist, community organizer, and hacker. 
		<br />
		<br />
          
                I have been working in the technology field for over 6 years, most recently in an Developer role where I build infrastructure and automation workflows to support the needs of customers in an efficient and scalable way. 

		Previously, I worked in a DevOps / Site Reliability Engineering role, and  made a foray into MLOps after some <a href="https://alleycorpnord.com/assessing-chatgpts-performance-on-software-engineering-test-questions/">experiments with ChatGPT</a>, in addition to <a href="https://alleycorpnord.com/bagels-robots-and-metro-adventures-part-1/">playing with robots</a>.   

		Before that, I was employed as a Quality Assurance Developer, and moved quickly into a lead role in that domain, where I also managed releases and ran regular team meetings. I also have experience with customer support and have demonstrated excellent technical writing skills throughout my career. 
		

		<br />
		<br />

		I'm always looking for new things to learn, whether tools to improve my productivity at work, or side projects to expand in other areas.

		I enjoy playing with the linux terminal and learning about application security and penetration testing. In the past few years I've participated in 
		<a href="https://montrehack.ca/">MontreHack</a> and <a href="https://nsec.io/">NorthSec</a> both as a learner and as a volunteer. 
		Badge-soldering and key-casting were among my favourite activities at NorthSec 2023. I'm now responsible for the <a href="https://nsec.io/code-of-conduct/"> NorthSec Code of Conduct</a> and recently also joined the organization's infrastructure team. 

		<br />
		<br />

		I appreciate open source, backward-compatibility and sustainable design in hardware and software, as well as privacy-preserving technologies,
		and make contributions to such projects when I can.

		I take pleasure in combining multiple generations of technology (I aspire towards having a setup like that of Adam in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714915/">Only Lovers Left Alive</a>).
		
		<br />
		<br />
		I've made a video game proof-of-concept through the <a href="https://pixelles.ca/"> Pixelles</a> Game Incubator. My goal was to use the eight weeks of the Incubator to complete a teaser for a larger project, in which I hoped to incorporate elements of hardware and software hacking. The latest build is available <a href="https://bluemona.itch.io/after-mars">here</a>.

		<br />
		<br />		
		I have a strong teaching background as well, having worked as a teaching assistant for both Introductory Computer Science and Anthropology courses. 
		I have taught a course on basic computer skills to hard-of-hearing individuals. I have also taught English as a Second Language, and have significant experience as a tutor.
		Courses I have tutored for have included high school math and science, test prep (SAT), and university-level courses on introductory programming, qualitative research methods, and statistics.             
		<br />
		<br />

		I have 
		an M.A. in Social and Cultural Anthropology from Concordia University in Montreal, and
		a B.Sc. from McGill University (joint major in Computer Science and Biology). 
        <br />
		<br />
		Outside of tech work, I am currently Vice President of the Board of Directors of the <a href="https://www.iccongress.ca/about" >Iranian Canadian Congress</a>. Prior work I take pride in includes acting as president for the <a href="https://www.qpirgconcordia.org/" > QPIRG Concordia</a> board of directors, 
		hosting the Montreal chapter of the #BecauseWeveRead book club launched by <a href="https://hodakatebi.com/" Hoda Katebi ></a>, and volunteering as an active listener for the <a href="https://genderadvocacy.org/" >Center for Gender Advocacy</a>.
