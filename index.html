        My name is Zahra Ghassemi Zavieh, but you can call me Mona.
        I have a bachelor's degree from McGill, a joint major in Computer Science and Biology, and a master's degree in Social and Cultural Anthropology from Concordia.
        <!--I am currently working on my bachelor's degree, a joint major in Computer Science and Biology.-->
<!--    I have been a teaching assistant for COMP 202 since (year?).                                                                                                     
        I am also currently doing some work for Professor Dirk Schlimm's COMP 230 class.                                                                                 
        I have other teaching experience, including high school and CEGEP-level math and science tutoring, and drawing lessons for children and                          
        adolescents.                                                                                                                                                     
        I also have experience editing papers in English.                                                                                                                
        I enjoy cooking and making art.
