                My name is Zahra Ghassemi Zavieh, but you can call me Mona.
                I have a bachelor's degree from McGill (a joint major in Computer Science and Biology), and a master's degree in Social and Cultural Anthropology from Concordia University in Montreal.
                I am currently seeking a job in either the education sector or as a junior developer in the software/tech industry (I have recently been focusing primarily on web development).
