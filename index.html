                My name is Mona Ghassemi.

		<br />
		<br />
                I have a bachelor's degree from McGill (a joint major in Computer Science and Biology), and a master's degree in Social and Cultural Anthropology from Concordia University in Montreal.
		<br />
		<br />            
           
                I am an educator, artist, community organizer, and coder. 
		<br />
		<br />
          
                I am currently employed by Workjam, Inc., after being hired by Peerio Technologies prior to the acquisition of the latter by Workjam.
		<br />
		<br />		
		I have worked as a teaching assistant for both Introductory Computer Science and Anthropology courses. 
		I have taught a course on basic computer skills to hard-of-hearing individuals. I have also taught English as a Second Language, and have significant experience as a tutor
		(courses have included high school math and science, test prp (SAT), and university-level courses on introductory programming, qualitative research methods, and statistics).             
		<br />
		<br />
